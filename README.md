# tap-notebooks-zeppelin

These are Apache Zeppelin notebooks that utilise TAP. This repo has been adapted from one setup for LASI'17 workshop. Those files remain, but are archived in the lasi17 directory as they were written for tapv1 (REST based).

The top level files utilise the current version of TAP which presents a GraphQL API.
